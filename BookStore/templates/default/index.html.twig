With the evidence that she found, the footprints of the chicken were gone after reached the neighbour house yard. In the meanwhile, the smell of chicken stew coming out from Myrtle's house. Myrtle, a strong and ferocious woman in this village, she won a fight with couples of teenagers back then, and even burn down people’s house. Geraldine was so scared of meeting her, and wished that her son, Jack had lost contact for years, working at nowhere, was at home right now. Before the sun gone from the sky, Geraldine kept thinking that should she face to face met with Myrtle about the chicken that vanish. Even though is only a chicken, if not deal this problem within today, it’s going to be forever too late for tomorrow. However, Geraldine still does not have the bravery to talk with her neighbour, so she decided to work in different way that taught by her passed away husband. She told everyone she met in the village with following word such as, “Did you saw my chicken?”, “Hmm, my chicken was gone this evening without any symptom.” or even “I notice that my chicken last known spot was around my neighbour house.”. She slowly moved herself to her neighbour house, and shout loudly “Who stolen my chicken?”. “What happened, Geraldine?” asked Myrtle after heard some noise from outside. “Not sure which asshole has stolen my chicken this evening.”, replied by Geraldine with a feeling of terrified by her neighbour and even spoke rudely “How’s my chicken coming back if someone already killed it!” when Myrtle told her that the chicken will come back after a while.
        Myrtle had a feeling that her ignorance neighbour has suspected she the one who stolen the chicken. “Are you thinking that I’m the one who stole your chicken? When did I eat your chicken? Please let it be clearly now before you leave.”, refuted by Myrtle with a fierce sound. “I didn’t say that you stole that chicken, you say that yourself.”, replied Geraldine. “When did I say that I stole your chicken! Besides that, I got my own chicken also.”, replied Myrtle angrily. “Since you already eat the chicken, I don’t have any proof about the chicken is mine.”, said Geraldine. The weather still continues raining heavily, Myrtle is grabbing Geraldine collar, looking into her eyes. Suddenly, Myrtle slapped her faced, the sound was even louder than the rain. Geraldine start crying but still managed to fight back, until the rest of the people in this village arrived. Geraldine already lying on the ground, keep calling his husband and son name. “I was framed up by her about the missing chicken.”, shouted Myrtle to the crowd, after that she said to the people “Since everyone is here, I put my word down. If I stole her chicken, I will suicide now in front of her.” Geraldine sit up and pointed to Myrtle “Well, if you have stolen my chicken, your son will died in this year. If not, my son then will die this year.” “Sure, let’s see whose son will dead this year then.”, replied Myrtle then went back to her own house. Geraldine now feels like she had won the fight and sleep over while crying. The next morning day, the chicken came back with a wet feather and a red ribbon on its leg. She quietly brings the chicken back to home and kill it. After that day, she feels guilty to Myrtle until she realised that even her neighbour didn’t steal the chicken but doesn’t mean there are no problem on her personality. She still remembers the blood taste in her mouth when she was slapped by Myrtle. Since then, they never talk to each other and tied a red ribbon on every chicken leg with the word “who stole the chicken, DIED!”
